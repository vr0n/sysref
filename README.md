Have *YOU* wondered why there is no utility that can be run in a terminal
that prints out syscall documentation for common architectures you may
want to write shellcode for? If you answered "Yes" to the previous question,
you are alone! But, don't worry! I see you and made sysref to do just this!

Just do this:
```
make
sudo make install
ref
```

All data is practically just copied/pasted from syscall.sh
